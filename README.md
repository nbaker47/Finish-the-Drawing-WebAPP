  <h1>Finish the Drawing!</h1>

  <h3>✏️ Daily competitiions to finish the drawing</h3>

</div>

# Overview

Every day we generate a random scribble and a new word. Your goal is to use your imagination to use that scribble to create a drawing of that word. You can view and rank other users submissions, and the top three drawings of the day will win.

## Future Ideas:

### Party mode:

Users invite other people either via username or from their friends list to play in a private game.

- Players swap roles each round
- During the start of each round user perform a task for their role, unaware of what the other users are doing
- There is a "scribbler" role, who draws the initial scribble
  - They use a limited pallet of ink
- There is an "author" role, who sets the word
- Then all users must use the scribble to draw the word
